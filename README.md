I downloaded tick-by-tick data from Truefx - a website recommended in the lecture slides. With 3 million rows and data exhibiting high noise. I decided to aggregate the dataset to 1 minutes
Thanks to time-aggregation, I could compute the number of ticks per minute - a feature representing market volume in this context. Additionally, I computed all the OHLC quotes for both BID and ASK. Here, I made a simplifying assumption and I set a “middle average price per minute” representing (average_ask - average_bid) / 2. So for each row I obtained one universal price.
I was very cautious about missing values - I needed to exclude everything in the time range Fridays 5 P.M. - Sundays P.M. Additionally I excluded the last 5 minutes before market closing (16 55 Fridays) for “safety” reasons (I could have also hardcoded this time as flat position, but I chose to drop) and the first 10 minutes on Sunday 17 00 - 17 10 - not really for safety reasons - I input lagged features to 10th period, so I would get some NAs or last values that occurred on Friday which makes no sense
The most important feature in my case was log returns of my aferomentionned universal minute price - middle average price per minute (ln_mid_returns). 
Before going further wit feature engineering, I made train/test split. It was essential to avoid data leakage which might have occurred if I added any lagged features before the split. 
I added features related to OHLC prices log returns (and their lags), 2 dummy variables for Friday and Sunday. I made 10 lags - 1,2,3…10 for OHLC and askbid average spread.
